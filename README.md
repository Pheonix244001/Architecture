# Protocol-Architectures-
Documentation of protocol architectures that I audited 
The documentation will contain 3 files 
1. .xmind - A mind map of all the contract inheritances ( You can open them by intalling Xmind app )
2. INFO.txt - A text file in which I have documented my thoughts upon diving into the codebase
3. Serial.txt - A text file that has a squence of contracts to be examined into that order
